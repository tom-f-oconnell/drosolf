-what is setup_requires / tests_require (+ stuff in setup.cfg) for if
 "python setup.py test" can not automatically install pytest?

-reproduce at least fig 5-6 in Olsen & Wilson (to the extent that I can w/
 available data, lack of seeds, etc), as one step to check PN transformation

-provide collection of plotting functions to reproduce style (for comparison
 + verification) of some keys plots in key papers
    -e.g. 5-6 from Olsen & Wilson, etc
    -how to make maximally re-usable

-provide collection of metrics that have been calculated in a lot of these
 papers
    -e.g. lifetime sparseness, etc

-how best to offer alternative models for calculations of a certain cell type?

-offer an interface to metadata about these cell types via other sources?
    -virtual fly brain? others?

-estimate (?) information lost at each layer
    -(of course, the reformatting does have advantages)

-what kind of ability do we have to predict ORN responses to new odors?
    - train classifier on Hallem / DoOR and check performance on held out
      examples within the datasets?

-better PN model? something accounting for the dynamics / differential
 sensitivity to inhibition? (particularly if using dynamic models downstream)
